# What Drives the Price of a Car?

## Overview

A used car dealership wants to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. This project analyzes 426,000 used car listings to identify key price drivers and provide actionable recommendations.

## Findings

The biggest factors that drive used car prices are:

1. **Vehicle age** — Cars under 5 years old have a median price of ~$37,900 vs ~$5,000 for cars over 20 years old
2. **Mileage** — Cars under 25,000 miles have a median of ~$34,000 vs ~$5,000 for 200k+ miles
3. **Vehicle type** — Pickups ($26,000 median) and trucks ($20,500) outsell sedans ($7,900)
4. **Fuel type** — Diesel ($27,000) commands more than double the price of gas ($11,000)
5. **Drive type** — 4WD ($16,500) is priced higher than FWD ($7,500)
6. **Title status** — Clean titles are essential; salvage and parts-only titles dramatically reduce value

### Recommendations for the Dealership

- Stock newer, low-mileage vehicles — these two factors matter most
- Prioritize pickups and trucks over sedans
- Look for diesel and 4WD vehicles for their price premiums
- Avoid salvage title/condition vehicles
- Consider high-volume brands (Ford, Chevrolet, Toyota) — most listings in the dataset, suggesting strong market presence
